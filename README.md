# Listing Posts with Delete & Edit

- get request from api https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
- listing posts in a table
- delete posts
- edit posts by redirecting to details page that lists a single post to edit
- use localStorage to store the single post on edit view because on refresh the data stays the same
- showing a snackbar when updating posts successfully.
